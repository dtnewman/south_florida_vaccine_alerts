                <ul>
                    <li>Runs on AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a> +
                        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">API Gateway</a> (there is no permanent server).
                    </li>
                    <li>Built with the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> framework and deployed
                        using the <a href="https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa">Zappa</a> package.
                    </li>
                    <li>The backend uses a PostgreSQL database to store information.</li>
                    <li>This site has a few pages (Home, About, etc.) and also features the ability to register
                        and login as a user. I intentionally kept it simple so that this project can be used as a basis
                        for your own projects!
                    </li>
                    <li>Checkout the project on <a href="https://github.com/dtnewman/zappa_boilerplate">github</a>.
                        Feel free to use it and modify as you see fit. Contributions to the project are always welcome.
